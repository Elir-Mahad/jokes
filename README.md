# Jokes expo app

The app's components are separated into 2 folders. The navigation folder contains the react navigations screens. The components folder contains all the non-navigation components. Here is a folder-based breakdown: 

    App
    navigation
     - DrawerNav
     - TabsNav
    components
     - DrawerButton
     - Tab1
     - Tab2
     - FullJoke

Some of the components are nested within other components, so let's breakdown what the component hierarchy looks like. This will help us better understand the flow of data through the application.

### Component overview
- The **App** component is going to be the parent component of all other components in our app.

- The **DrawerNav** component contains  the TabsNav, DrawerButton, and FullJoke. 
  
  - The **TabsNav** component contains the tab navigation from which the user can access Tab1 and Tab2. Currently Tab1 and tab2 don't contain anything.
  
  - The **DrawerButton** component will be responsible for fetching the joke api data, sending the joke setup as a push notification, and ensuring that when the user clicks on the notification, they get redirected to the FullJoke screen.
  
  - The **FullJoke** component displays the joke delivery. 

### My workflow:

For this project i used githubs kanban to manage issues, tasks, etc. Here is the project [kanban](https://github.com/Elir-Mahad/jokes/projects/1) 

I divided my time in the following order: 

1. Research on what the project entails and what tools i will need.

2. Write out issues and tasks based on what i assume the project entails.
  - The research was continous so i refined my issues and tasks whenever it seemed necessary. 

3. Coding out the project. You will notice that each task was upon completiton committed.

### Finding listed resources

Inside each issue, you will see a list of tasks. 

For some of the tasks, i've attached external links as resources for further perusal or review.

To find the resources, you can read the issues to see all the resources.

Alternatively, you can look at the commit log. Each commit that has a comment, will have an issue shared in the comment. That issue will contain the resources for that specific commit.

### Test criteria:

Below is the test criteria from the email.

Under each bullet, i've attached related issues. 

- Using Expo and React Navigation, build a basic app skeleton. Refer to [issue-number-1](https://github.com/Elir-Mahad/jokes/issues/1)
 
- Add two tabs on the bottom. Each tabbed page can display text saying tab 1, tab2. Refer to [issue-number-2](https://github.com/Elir-Mahad/jokes/issues/2)

- Add a drawer that can be accessed on the left. Refer to [issue-number-3](https://github.com/Elir-Mahad/jokes/issues/3)
 
- There will be a button in the drawer saying "show me a joke," which will request a random joke from the [endpoint here](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any) and immediately trigger a push notification to show on the device that displays the joke's setup. Upon clicking the notification, the drawer will close, and a new stacked page will open on top of the root tab view that displays the joke's delivery/punchline. Refer to [issue-number-4](https://github.com/Elir-Mahad/jokes/issues/4) and [issue-number-5](https://github.com/Elir-Mahad/jokes/issues/5)

- Please upload your project to GitHub and share the link once completed. Refer to [issue-number-6](https://github.com/Elir-Mahad/jokes/issues/6)
  - Here is the link to the expo snack site : https://snack.expo.dev/@mahad_codes/jokes-app
   - To view the site, download the android expo go app, and scan the QR code.


### Assumptions:

_Since it was stated in the email, that no assistance or guidance will be offered , the following assumptions were made based on the success criteria._ 

1. Since expo and react navigation are being used, a react native [expo app](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/) was chosen. 

2. Since expo has been stated, [expo notifications](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#api) was used for the push notification.

### Bugs and problems:

Enviroment issues: 

- The expo go app, does not function well and it is too slow. This makes development slow. 

Bugs: 

- There was a bug with how the data gets passed between screens. It is documented [here](https://github.com/Elir-Mahad/jokes/issues/7).

- Currently, if the user clicks on the full joke button thatâ€™s in the drawer nav, it produces an error.
Reason is not clear.  

- When the user clicks the notification and they are redirected to the FullJoke page, the expo.dev app shows a warning that it has disconnected from the mobile. The reason is not clear.
