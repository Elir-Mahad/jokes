# Jokes react navigation expo app

### Success criteria:

- [ ] Using Expo and React Navigation, build a basic app skeleton with two tabs on the bottom and a drawer that can be accessed on the left.
- Each tabbed page can display text saying tab 1, tab2.

- [ ] There will be a button in the drawer saying "show me a joke," which will request a random joke from the endpoint here and immediately trigger a push notification to show on the device that displays the joke's setup. 

- [ ] Upon clicking the notification, the drawer will close, and a new stacked page will open on top of the root tab view that displays the joke's delivery/punchline. 

- [ ] Please upload your project to GitHub and share the link once completed. 

- [ ] Feel free to take this further in any way you see fit (e.g. filters, etc.).


### Assumptions:

_Since it was stated in the email, that no assistance or guidance will be offered , the following assumptions were made based on the success criteria._ 

1. Since expo and react navigation are being used, a react native [expo app](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/) was chosen. 

2. Since expo has been stated, [expo notifications](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#api) was used for the push notification.
